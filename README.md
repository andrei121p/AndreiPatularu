Hi, I'm Andrei, currently a  Master's student in Financial Engineering at EPFL. Interested in quantitative finance, investments, and machine learning projects applied to financial data.


## Projects

**[Global Portfolio Strategies](https://github.com/andrei121p/Investments_project)**  
- Analyses international diversification and dynamic trading strategies for US investors.  
- Implements portfolio strategies: Risk-Parity, Mean-Variance, Momentum, Reversal, Carry, and Dollar strategies.  
- Combines stock indices and currency data; evaluates performance using Sharpe ratios and factor models.  

**[Residual Neural Network for Daily Stock Returns](https://github.com/andrei121p/ML-Project)**  
- Developed a PyTorch-based residual neural network on 23M+ CRSP daily returns and 41 Compustat firm fundamentals.  
- Tested the impact of macroeconomic data on daily stock return forecasts using feature engineering and a macro index constructed via Partial Least Squares.  
- Implemented custom loss functions and integrated transaction cost models with turnover constraints.  
- Achieved a monthly Sharpe ratio of ~0.35 and outperformed the S&P 500 in select post-COVID periods.  


**Mathematical Modelling for Image Reconigtion** *(Private Project)*  
- Developed a machine learning model to classify images from a dataset into distinct categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  
- Trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%, optimizing accuracy on the test set.  
- Explored model improvements including alternative datasets (e.g., CIFAR10), layer structure adjustments, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.  
- Focused on feature extraction, convolutional filters, pooling, and ReLU activations to maximize classification performance.  
- Highlights applied skills in image recognition, CNN design, and model evaluation.
